## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can accurately classify stars into different categories based on their spectra. Spectral data provides valuable insights into the composition, temperature, and luminosity of stars, making it an interesting avenue for both astronomy research and machine learning experimentation.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/star-classifier.git
   cd star-classifier
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

This project provides functionalities for training the model, evaluating its performance, and making predictions on new data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluating the model is available at [link-to-dataset](https://example.com/dataset). It consists of labeled spectral data for various types of stars. Make sure to download and organize the dataset as described in the `data/README.md` file.

## Model Architecture

The star classifier model is built using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/), making use of a deep neural network architecture. The architecture is defined in the `model.py` script.

## Training

To train the star classifier model, run the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

This will train the model using the preprocessed dataset and save the trained weights in the `models/` directory.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the model's performance, use the following command:

```bash
python evaluate.py
```

This script will load the trained model and assess its accuracy and other relevant metrics using the test dataset.

## Inference

To classify stars using the trained model, utilize the inference script:

```bash
python classify_star.py --spectra path/to/spectral/data.txt
```

Replace `path/to/spectral/data.txt` with the path to the spectral data you want to classify.
